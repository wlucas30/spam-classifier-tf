# spam-classifier-tf
 This project uses a TensorFlow neural network to classify emails into either spam or not spam.

# Usage instructions
 You must add a dataset for spam email classification with the filename `combined_data.csv`. The dataset should be organised into a `label` column and `text` column, where the label 1 represents spam and 0 represents not spam. You can use your own dataset or download the one I used (further down).
 The model can be trained by running main.py. You will then be prompted to enter email text until the program is interrupted.

# Dataset source
 This project uses the Spam Email Classification Dataset I found on Kaggle:
